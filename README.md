# Distracted Driver Posture and Head Position Identification via m-CNNs. [Paper](https://github.com/kurshakuz/distracted_driver_detection/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Project_Report.pdf) 

This work is initially inspired by the State Farm's Distracted Driver Detection [Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/overview) and by the work done by [Eraqi et al.](https://heshameraqi.github.io/distraction_detection)

The aim of this work is to go beyond the initial limitations of the above approaches by intoroducing second camera to monitor driver's frontal and facial features along with his/her posture. The approach is based on individual image classifications on ResNet50 models which are then used as an input for final model based on multi-modal approach. More information on the approach, dataset generation, and results can be found [here](https://github.com/kurshakuz/distracted_driver_detection/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Project_Report.pdf)
